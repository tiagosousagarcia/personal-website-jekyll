Writing with AI is an [ATNU project]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _projects/02-atnu.md %}) led by me and [Laura McKenzie](https://durham.academia.edu/LauraMcKenzie), in collaboration with [Seven Stories, the national centre for children's books](https://www.sevenstories.org.uk/). At various points, this project was called the *Creative Engine*, the *Writing Wizard*, and even *The title of the app is the most important part of it, right?*, though this was itself the result of asking an AI what I should call the project. To be perfectly honest, we are yet to find an adequate title for this, so for now we will refer to it with the rather descriptive and boring *Writing with AI*.

Essentially, the project is an interface that allows children and young people to interact with a text-generating AI to write a short story. The AI will be trained on archival materials from Seven Stories, and refined to produce writing suggestions suitable for the younger crowd. It will serve both as a gateway for exploring the Seven Stories' collection, and a study of human and machine creativity.

We are currently working hard behind the scenes to get this project funded and off the ground, but I wrote a very short prototype in Python using the bog-standard version of [GPT-2](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-2-1-5b-release/). T[he code is available on my GitHub](https://github.com/tiagosousagarcia/small-utilities-python/tree/master/text_generation), but it requires a certain amount of preparation and familiarisation with Python to run. If that's you, have a look at it.
