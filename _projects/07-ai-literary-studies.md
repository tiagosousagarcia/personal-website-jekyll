AI and Literary Studies, or *Reading Machines*, to give it its proper name, is a research network that brings together scholars from literary studies, digital humanities, and computer science, to study how Artificial Intelligence can play a part in humanities' research.

The ultimate objective of the network is to figure out whether it is possible to create (or train, repurpose, refit) an Artificial Intelligence that can perform the task of reading a text in a way that would more closely resemble what humans understand as *reading*, that is a process in which the text is not only taken at face-value, but that takes into account other features that create meaning from literature: context, intertextuality, polyssemy. [To borrow a term from Mike Kestemont and Luc Herman](https://umanisticadigitale.unibo.it/article/view/8511), the network wants to understand whether we can model a reader.

This project is currently in draft form: it will be submitted to the [Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC)](https://ahrc.ukri.org/), specifically to their [Research Networking Schme](https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/ahrc-research-networking-scheme/). Although the drafting is in quite an advanced stage, it has not been submitted or funded just yet.
