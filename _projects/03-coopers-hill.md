Despite its single heading, Coopers Hill is, in fact, the collection of several different, but related, projects. The ultimate objective of this project is the creation of a scholarly digital edition of the mid-seventeenth century poem Coopers Hill, by [John Denham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Denham_(poet)). In the process of achieving that ultimate goal, it is also a simple edition created for teaching, and the starting point for [a pilot project that can (hopefully) be generalised to other editions]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _projects/04-auto-collation.md %}).

## the poet and the poem

*Coopers Hill* is a seventeenth century poem written by the royalist poet and courtier Sir John Denham, between the early 1640s and the mid 1650s.

The poem is Denham's most famous work, though its fame waned drastically since the time of its first publication. Denham was also a playwright and a translator, publishing (as many of his contemporaries did) a version of the *[Aeneid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeneid)*.

Like many of his contemporaries, Denham's work and career is largely tied to the tremendous political and social upheavel of their time, [the Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Civil_War). Denham is usually identified with the royalist group (i.e., those who sided with the King and opposed Parliament) though, as many historians have noted, such gross generalisations are just that. Given the bad fortune of the royalist side during the conflict, Denham eventually left England at the end of the 1640s to join the exiled court in Paris, returning home in the early 1650s, penniless. He would not recover his status until after the [Restoration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Restoration), though he died at the end of the decade, in 1669 at the age of 54, suffering at that time from what we now understand (and believe to have been) as dementia.

*Coopers Hill* is worthy of attention, not only because it is Denham's most famous poem but also for its curious relationship with the period and complexity of its composition.

The poem is one of the first (if not the first) of so-called *[topographical poems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topographical_poetry)*, a subgenre of poetry that deals mostly with the description and praise of place. In the case of Denham's work, that place is the titular [Cooper's Hill](https://goo.gl/maps/T5rckXFc4WiFkGdSA), Surrey, near Windsor and Runnymede, [the place where the Magna Carta was signed in 1215](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Carta). The poem's speaker climbs to the top of the hill and uses the landscape around it to muse on British History until that point in time: from its Roman History, Danish and Norman invasions, the signing of the Magna Carta and the much more recent events of the break with Rome and dissolution of the monasteries under Henry VIII. Throughout the retelling of British (specifically English) history and the observation of place, the tenor of Denham's speaker is distinctively royalist in outlook: though that outlook does not remain stable throughout the entire history of the poem.

*Coopers Hill* is particularly noteworthy for its composition and publication history. The poem was first published in 1642 (though it likely circulated in manuscript before that date), and goes on to be published at least five more times, in 1643, 1650, 1653 (of which only one copy is known), 1655, and 1668. The interesting thing is that, of those six *editions* (if you forgive the anachronism), no two are alike; more so between the 1650 and the 1655 edition, when the poem goes through a significant rewriting that alters its reading in a major way.

The keen-eyed probably noticed that a major development took place between 1650 and 1653: the royalists finally, and decisively, lost the civil war (specifically in 1651, at the [battle of Worcester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Worcester), of [Royal Oak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Oak) fame). A couple of years before that, England had also, for the first time in history, [tried and executed its king for treason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_of_Charles_I). Likely as a direct result of those events (as well as a myriad others, now less clear for modern readers), Denham rewrote a significant portion of *Coopers Hill* to the point of creating an entirely new reading, changing the underlying message of the poem from one that seems to warn against revolution to one that regrets its excesses. In other words, though *Coopers Hill* has a unique title (and is often presented as a singular poem), it is better understood as (at least) two entirely different texts; or, to put it bluntly, if offers a perfect laboratory of how literature was affected by the political context of the mid seventeenth century.

The ultimate goal of the *Coopers Hill* project is to create a fully functional [scholarly digital edition](https://www.openbookpublishers.com/htmlreader/978-1-78374-238-7/ch2.xhtml) of the poem in which all versions are visible, accessible, and their differences are made clear to the reader through an interactive interface.

The particular characteristics of *Coopers Hill* make it a perfect candidate for a digital treatment (if such a qualification was necessary):

* the print paradigm is wholly innadequte to communicate textual variance, but utterly useless when faced with significant rewrites of the kind that we see in the various editions of the poem (to the point that a previous editor decided to print *four* different whole versions of the poem, one following the other, [in its previous major scholarly edition](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Expansd-Hieroglyphics-Study-Denhams-Coopers/dp/0520014960));
* the topographical nature of the poem offers many opportunities to take advantage of the digital realm, from a simple mapping of the location mentioned, to the accompanying contemporary illustrations (when they exist), or modern-day representations of the locations explored in the poem;
* similarly, the poem's reliance on the English historical past, not to mention its intertextuality, opens the opportunity to considerably enrich the edition with additional documents, longer explanatory notes, or links to other resources and further reading.

A further advantage of opting for a digital scholarly edition rather than a traditional print one when it comes to *Coopers Hill* needs a little more information about the practice of scholarly editing itself. A fundamental aspect of scholarly editing is *[collation](https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095623868)*, that is the comparison, recording, and selection of all (or as many as possible) known variants of the text. Traditionally, the collation of early modern texts considers essential only manuscript versions (when they are shown to have authorial authority, or derive from the author's circle), and a handful of print examples from each possible publication. With *Coopers Hill,* the ambition is to experiment with total collation (or as near to that as humanly possible), that is the recording and comparison of *all* known witnesses of the text, both print and manuscript. It might seem like overkill to want to compare all (likely similar) print copies of the poem, but there are two main reasons for this:

1. The fact that Coopers Hill was the object of such drastic rewrites, and the nature of early modern printing more generally, raises the possibility that smaller rewrites or autograph corrections made only to a subset of print copies of a particular edition might remain undiscovered;
1. Collecting the complete list of possible variants on several early modern print runs will create a valuable dataset that could, possibly, offer a new perspective on early modern printing itself which, so far, has relied on its most famous, over-examined cases (Shakespeare and his First Folio, in particular) as examples of contemporary practice.

The problem, of course, is that all these print copies are spread throughout the world, and there is no feasible way of undertaking this work in a single period. Even when a project is fully funded by a research body (which, unfortunately, is currently not the case for *Coopers Hill*), the work of visiting libraries, examining, transcribing and comparing each textual witness takes time. Working in the digital world offers a slight panacea to this problem: we can add copies as and when we have a chance to examine, transcribe, and encode them. In other words, the ambition of *Coopers Hill* is not only to be a scholarly digital edition of the poem, but an *iterative* edition, in which the infrastructure remains stable even when more transcriptions and encoded versions of the poem are added. This, then, is the base idea behind [the collation project outlined below]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _projects/04-auto-collation.md %}).

## the student edition of coopers hill

There is an additional proble with *Coopers Hill* that this project attempts to solve: if you want to teach the poem to undergraduate (or even postgraduate) students, there is no standard edition of the poem easily available that presents, at the very least, its two major versions together. The last serious attempt at a scholarly edition was published in 1969 and never republished (though now seems to be available as a print-on-demand option), which means that students are left with the versions that are sometimes published in anthologies of the period which, more often than not, reprint the post-1655 version.

This was the problem that I faced a couple of years ago, when I first wanted to teach the poem to my second year students on a module about literature and history. The solution? Well, a rough-and-ready digital edition of *Coopers Hill*. To be more precise, two separate *transcriptions*, one from the 1642 text, another from the 1655.

I say, carefully, *transcription* because there was no effort at collation, regularisation, or standardisation in these versions of the text. Their only objective was to offer a simple, readable text from either edition, together with some cursory explanatory notes to help their understanding. The layout of the page was also kept as spartan as possible.

The transcriptions were encoded in [TEI](https://tei-c.org/) (as it would be expected), and the HTML was generated using an XSLT transformation, with simple inline CSS styling to save on unnecessary frills. The encoded versions of both texts, as well as the XSLT transformations are [available on my GitHub](https://github.com/tiagosousagarcia/Denham-Coopers-Hill-SDE/tree/SEL2218_Edition). You can see the texts my students read here:
