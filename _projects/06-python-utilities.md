blurb: An assortment of small python scripts to perform small, boring tasks.

There's not much to say about this one: this is a number of small python scripts I wrote to either: a) try out something new, b) learn a new approach or method; or c) get something done. All of them are [available on my github](https://github.com/tiagosousagarcia/small-utilities-python/). They are an ever shifting collection: the current script that might be of interest to anyone else besides me is the script that strips speaker labels from Zoom-generated captions (if, like me, [you've been hosting speakers, recording their talks, and making them available online](https://research.ncl.ac.uk/atnu/atnuiesvisitingspeakers/).)
