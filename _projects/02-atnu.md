I joined [Animating Text Newcastle University (ATNU)](https://research.ncl.ac.uk/atnu/) in late 2017 as a Research Associate. ATNU is a research project that brought together humanists, computers scientists and [research software engineers](https://rse.ncldata.dev/) to explore digital ways of researching, exploring, and interacting with humanities' data in textual form. ATNU's main function was to experiment with, and push the boundaries of, digital humanities. ATNU eventually grew to encompass a [healthy and diverse group of researchers](https://research.ncl.ac.uk/atnu/people/), but most of the conceptual digital work was undertaken by me and [James Cummings](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/elll/people/profile/jamescummings.html), with [Jennifer Richards](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/elll/people/profile/jenniferrichards.html) leading the whole thing. Most of the actual coding was done by the wonderful RSE Team, in particular by Fiona Galston, Kate Court, and Mark Turner.

My role in the project, in addition to that of a general dogsbody, was to serve as a bridge between researchers in the humanities, for the most part without any technical abilities, and the RSE team, as well as to serve as a consultant to academic colleagues about the digital possibilities of their research projects, helping them to develop an interesting and (hopefully), significant contribution to Digital Humanities. The projects were varied, and my contribution to each equally varied, from a simple sounding board, to doing some textual encoding, or even creating simple but functioning prototypes (as is the case with the [Writing with AI]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _projects/05-writing-with-ai.md %}) project below).

[You can read more about each of the projects and my precise role in them in the ATNU page](https://research.ncl.ac.uk/atnu/projects/), but here's a one line description of the currently published pilot projects (in roughly reverse chronological order of publication):

* [Transatlantic Intellectual Networks](https://research.ncl.ac.uk/atnu/projects/transatlanticintellectualnetworks/)
The study of the correspondence network of David Bailie Warden. The project was led by [Jennifer Orr](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/elll/people/profile/jenniferorr.html), the textual encoding and network visualisations by [Sharon Howard](http://sharonhoward.org/).

* [Poetic Transformations](https://research.ncl.ac.uk/atnu/projects/poetictransformations/#d.en.870686)
An experiment in how to visualise the complex composition history of contemporary poetry, including multiple parallel drafts, print proofs, and recorded live readings. The project was led by [Mark Byers](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/elll/staff/profile/markbyers2.html), [Sinead Morrissey](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/elll/staff/profile/sineadmorrissey.html), and [Linda Anderson](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/elll/staff/profile/lindaanderson.html). I did the textual encoding.

* [Manuscripts after Print](https://research.ncl.ac.uk/mssafterprint/)
Manuscripts after Print was an AHRC funded research project led by [Aditi Nafde](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/elll/people/profile/aditinafde.html). As part of that project, ATNU developed a [Hands-on Reading app](https://hands-on-reading.atnu.ncl.ac.uk/login), a web application that allows users to read and freely annotate a portion of the *[Canterbury Tales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canterbury_Tales)* in a simulation of an early printed book.

* [Mapping Translations](https://research.ncl.ac.uk/atnu/projects/mappingtranslations/#d.en.870685)
An interactive, chronological map tracing the European translations of the works of the early feminist [Mary Wollstonecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Wollstonecraft), led by [Laura Kirkley](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/elll/people/profile/laurakirkley.html). As well as general consulting and data wrangling, I also created an early prototype of the project using the now (sadly) non-existent [Google Fusion Tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Fusion_Tables).

* [Early Modern Ballot](https://research.ncl.ac.uk/atnu/projects/earlymodernballot/#d.en.870683)
Taking the mission of ATNU a little too literally, this is an animation of an early modern engraving describing a new form of balloting proposed by [James Harrington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harrington_(author)). The project was led by [Rachel Hammersley](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/hca/people/profile/rachelhammersley.html).

* [Soundscapes of Text](https://research.ncl.ac.uk/atnu/projects/soundscapesoftext/#d.en.870090)
An interface to study the influence of prosodic and rethorical emphasis in voiced readings of early modern texts, using a text-to-speech engine (specifically [Amazon's Polly](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/)). The project was led by [Jennifer Richards](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/elll/people/profile/jenniferrichards.html).

* [Sarum Hymnal](https://research.ncl.ac.uk/atnu/projects/sarummanuscript/#d.en.870684)
A digital edition of the Sarum Hymnal, including facsimiles, metadata, and an experimental navigation of the hymns through the liturgical calendar. The project was led by [Magnus Williamson](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/sacs/staff/profile/magnuswilliamson.html).
