Coding for Humanists is a monthly study group dedicated to, well, teaching humanists how to code.

In my years [working with ATNU]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _projects/02-atnu.md %}) and talking to researchers from the Humanities that wanted to do something *digital* with their research, I became more aware of the problems those without a technical background face: not knowing where to begin, not knowing what is possible, the lack of of coding courses that don't automatically assume at least some degree of technical proficiency, and the lack of exercises targeted to humanities' questions: sure, you might be able to replicate [the Bernoulli Trial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_trial) for a coin toss, but how is that going to help you make sense of the historical data you need to work with?

For that last problem, luckily, there are a few solutions available: a handful of books like [Humanities Data Analysis](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Humanities-Data-Analysis-Studies-Python/dp/0691172366) or [Text Analysis with R for Students of Literature](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Analysis-Students-Literature-Quantitative-Humanities/dp/3319349198/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=matthew+jockers&qid=1621415522&s=books&sr=1-3), an assortment of online tutorials (that assume you know what you are looking for), and, perhaps most significantly of all, the excellent [Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/).

Brilliant as those resources are, self-motivated and self-directed learning is not for everyone. Even with the best of intentions, pressing responsibilities will always take precedence unless there is a scheduled time for experimenting with coding. Even when individuals manage to set aside time to learn how to use digital methodologies for their research, there is still a couple of things missing: someone to ask questions of, and someone to bounce ideas from. Or, in other words, a tutor and a community of learning.

It is to address these last two problems that I created *Coding for Humanists*. Essentially, it is a guided study group, not a course or a workshop. For the most part, each month we take a lesson from the *Programming Historian* and run through it together, with me helping participants along the way and answering any questions that might arise. The uptake in the very first year surprised me: over forty registered participants! Though, of course, not everyone shows up everytime, which makes leading the session much easier.

For better or worst, *Coding for Humanists* was only available to Newcastle staff and PG students, but the experience demonstrates that there is a great appetite for this type of offer. Perhaps something for universities everywhere to chew on.
