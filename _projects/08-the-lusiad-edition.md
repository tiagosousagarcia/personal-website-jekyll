This project stems from [my PhD thesis](https://www.base-search.net/Record/3a32fe09592554c4310e744693bda7e00f2f3ebc252d7735ad7a1f228c82e152), in which I wrote about a particular translation of *Os Lus√≠adas* into English: the 1655 version by [Richard Fanshawe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Richard_Fanshawe,_1st_Baronet), [The Lusiad](https://purl.pt/14655).

The thesis itself started as an examination of the translation in relation to its contemporary context -- a few years after the royalist deafeat in the civil war, a few years before the Restoration of Charles II -- specifically on how Fanshawe, a stout supporter of the King, makes use of a foreign text to covertly intervene in the political debate in defense of royalism.

Various aspects of the original thesis have been published separately, [for example on an article for Literature Compass](https://doi.org/10.1111/lic3.12387) discussing the source text most likely used by Fanshawe for his translation. Spoiler alert, [it was a Spanish translation](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=c1GcNDdm7SoC&pg=PP5#v=onepage&q&f=false), not the original Portuguese.

In the course of my research, I also did a lot of work that sits more confortably in Book History and Translation Theory, that cannot be entirely divorced from a its original text. In other words, a lot of that work is the same that a textual editor would have done. *The Lusiad* edition, then, is an attempt at making that research visible and accessible, while providing a new edited text of the first English translation of the great Portuguese poem.

Although Fanshawe's *The Lusiad* [has been edited and re-published recently](https://www.oxfordscholarlyeditions.com/view/10.1093/actrade/9780198182993.book.1/actrade-9780198182993-book-1) (well, 22 years ago, but recent by academic standards), there are two major factors that make a newer edition attractive: first, since Davidson's edition, I've encountered at least one copy with autograph corrections that has not been previously considered; and second, my proposed edition would take a different editorial principle, considering the text, first and foremost, as a translation and editing it accordingly.

Owing to my [day to day responsibilities](https://tiagosousagarcia.co.uk/projects/projects.htm#atnu), this particular project is a little (ok, quite a bit) delayed, but it remains in my radar. Hopefully, I will have the chance to do some considerable progress in 2022.
