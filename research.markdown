My research can be divided into three main areas: early modern translation, digital textual editing, and computerised textual analysis. Divisions like this are, of necessity, artificial, and artificially delimiting the actual content of my research. These three areas of interest intersect at all points and, although I have divided them here for convinience, I don't think of any of these areas as divorced from the others.
