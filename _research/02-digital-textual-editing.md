title: Digital Textual Editing
layout: page
---

Research into digital textual editing is based on the practical use of [TEI](https://tei-c.org/) for early modern scholarly editions. I am also interested in the automation of editorial tasks, and the streamlining of TEI encoding for editors without technological backgrounds. I have taught several TEI workshops and I am currently one of the co-managing editors of the [jTEI](https://journals.openedition.org/jtei/)
