My early modern research is focused on the literary production of the English civil war, Interregnum and early Restoration (c. 1642-1666). In broad terms, I am interested in literary work that engages with the political context and, specifically, with the political uses of translations from contemporary continental authors into English. Broader interests include translation theory and practice, and personal writing (diaries, memoirs, autobiographies) in the early modern period.
