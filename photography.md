### Photography, for me, really means film photography.

I have done some sort of photography ever since I can remember: first as childish play with my parents' point-and-shoot, *sans* film of course, later graduating to actually being able to take pictures at special events and even, at least once, to take the cheap camera along by myself in a school trip to the zoo -- the result was a whole roll of fence close-ups.

When digital cameras became a viable consumer product, like everyone else, I moved to a world of low-resolution snaps. I got my first digital camera as a birthday present in my early teens -- a 5MP point-and-shoot HP. Eventually, I upgraded to a DSLR and, for most of my adult life, that was what I used to practice photography, mostly haphazardly but with a modicum of understanding of what was going on between light, glass, and sensor.

I returned to film photography only a few years ago, in 2019. I wrote a brief explanation of what led me to film photography in the [introduction of an article I wrote for Emulsive.org](https://emulsive.org/reviews/camera-reviews/yashica-camera-reviews/yashica-b-review-the-lovable-rare-tlr) (a review of one of my favourite film cameras, the Yashica-B) but, if you want the short version, this is it: I wanted to try medium format, bought a film camera, became hooked.

Since then, I have done all my Photography (capital "P") as well as most of my snapping, with a film camera. I own a total of ten film cameras, a mix between 35mm and medium format, including a couple of TLRs, a couple of rangefinders, a few SLRs, and even one folding camera. As objects, they are nice in themselves, but they all work (some more than others). I focused on black and white film at first for sensible economic reasons (usually cheaper), but grew to love the aesthetic and the fact that I can develop the film myself without great difficulty (it is, of course, also possible to process colour film at home, but the margin for mistake is much smaller). During the pandemic, I also built myself a small, precarious darkroom where I spend a few happy weekend afternoons printing my favourite frames (and by built, I mean blackening out a giant window everytime I want to turn the enlarger on).

I am no wiz photographer, I enjoy the process more than anything. But over the few years in which I have been doing this, I have created a few images that I am rather proud of: you can see those in my portfolio.
